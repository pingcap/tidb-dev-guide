# Bug Reports

## Report a Bug

To report a problem with TiDB, follow the [Bug Report template](https://github.com/pingcap/tidb/issues/new?assignees=&labels=type%2Fbug&template=bug-report.md) and provide detailed information about the problem you encountered and, if possible, add a description that helps to reproduce the problem.

The template looks like as below.

1. Minimal reproduce step
2. What did you expect to see?
3. What did you see instead 
4. What is your TiDB version?

## Fix the Bug

When the bug reported is recognized with consensus, you can ask for assignment and start fixing the bug after assigned. Note that only start working if there is consensus on the approach, otherwise the work is possibly in vain.

Later, open a pull request of the proposed fix and work with the reviewer.

With no less than two reviewers approving the pull request, a committer checks if the contribution fulfills the requirements and merges the code to the codebase.
