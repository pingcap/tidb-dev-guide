# Introduction

TiDB is developed by an open and friendly community. Everybody is cordially welcome to join the community and contribute to TiDB. There are several ways to interact with the community and to contribute to TiDB including filing bug reports, proposing new features or refactoring, joining discussions, or writing documentation.

## What do you want to do?

Contributing to TiDB goes beyond writing code for the project. Below, we list different opportunities to help the project:

- [Bug Reports](bug-reports.md)
- [Refactoring](refatoring.md)
- [Feature Proposals](feature-proposal.md)
- [Code Reviews](code-reviews.md)
- [Testing](testing.md)
- [Writing Documentation](writing-documentation.md)

Any other question? Reach out to the [TiDB Internals forum](https://internals.tidb.io/) to get help!
